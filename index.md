## Interactive Charts from R using [PolyCharts](https://github.com/Polychart/polychart2)

This R package helps users create interactive visualizations using [polychart.js](https://github.com/Polychart/polychart2), using a plotting interface similar to the [lattice](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html) package.

### Installation

You can install `rCharts` from `github` using the `devtools` package

```
require(devtools)
install_github('rCharts', 'ramnathv')
```

### Usage

`rCharts` uses a plotting interface similar to that of the `lattice` package. Here are a few examples you can try out in your R console.

### Example 1: Faceted Scatterplot

<div id='chart1' class='rChart'></div>


```r
require(rCharts)
names(iris) = gsub("\\.", "", names(iris))
p1 <- rPlot(SepalLength ~ SepalWidth | Species, data = iris, color = "Species", 
    type = "point")
p1$addParams(width = 550)
p1$printChart("chart1")
```

<script type='text/javascript'>
    var chartParams = {"dom":"chart1","width":550,"height":400,"layers":[{"x":"SepalWidth","y":"SepalLength","data":{"SepalLength":[5.1,4.9,4.7,4.6,5,5.4,4.6,5,4.4,4.9,5.4,4.8,4.8,4.3,5.8,5.7,5.4,5.1,5.7,5.1,5.4,5.1,4.6,5.1,4.8,5,5,5.2,5.2,4.7,4.8,5.4,5.2,5.5,4.9,5,5.5,4.9,4.4,5.1,5,4.5,4.4,5,5.1,4.8,5.1,4.6,5.3,5,7,6.4,6.9,5.5,6.5,5.7,6.3,4.9,6.6,5.2,5,5.9,6,6.1,5.6,6.7,5.6,5.8,6.2,5.6,5.9,6.1,6.3,6.1,6.4,6.6,6.8,6.7,6,5.7,5.5,5.5,5.8,6,5.4,6,6.7,6.3,5.6,5.5,5.5,6.1,5.8,5,5.6,5.7,5.7,6.2,5.1,5.7,6.3,5.8,7.1,6.3,6.5,7.6,4.9,7.3,6.7,7.2,6.5,6.4,6.8,5.7,5.8,6.4,6.5,7.7,7.7,6,6.9,5.6,7.7,6.3,6.7,7.2,6.2,6.1,6.4,7.2,7.4,7.9,6.4,6.3,6.1,7.7,6.3,6.4,6,6.9,6.7,6.9,5.8,6.8,6.7,6.7,6.3,6.5,6.2,5.9],"SepalWidth":[3.5,3,3.2,3.1,3.6,3.9,3.4,3.4,2.9,3.1,3.7,3.4,3,3,4,4.4,3.9,3.5,3.8,3.8,3.4,3.7,3.6,3.3,3.4,3,3.4,3.5,3.4,3.2,3.1,3.4,4.1,4.2,3.1,3.2,3.5,3.6,3,3.4,3.5,2.3,3.2,3.5,3.8,3,3.8,3.2,3.7,3.3,3.2,3.2,3.1,2.3,2.8,2.8,3.3,2.4,2.9,2.7,2,3,2.2,2.9,2.9,3.1,3,2.7,2.2,2.5,3.2,2.8,2.5,2.8,2.9,3,2.8,3,2.9,2.6,2.4,2.4,2.7,2.7,3,3.4,3.1,2.3,3,2.5,2.6,3,2.6,2.3,2.7,3,2.9,2.9,2.5,2.8,3.3,2.7,3,2.9,3,3,2.5,2.9,2.5,3.6,3.2,2.7,3,2.5,2.8,3.2,3,3.8,2.6,2.2,3.2,2.8,2.8,2.7,3.3,3.2,2.8,3,2.8,3,2.8,3.8,2.8,2.8,2.6,3,3.4,3.1,3,3.1,3.1,3.1,2.7,3.2,3.3,3,2.5,3,3.4,3],"PetalLength":[1.4,1.4,1.3,1.5,1.4,1.7,1.4,1.5,1.4,1.5,1.5,1.6,1.4,1.1,1.2,1.5,1.3,1.4,1.7,1.5,1.7,1.5,1,1.7,1.9,1.6,1.6,1.5,1.4,1.6,1.6,1.5,1.5,1.4,1.5,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.3,1.5,1.3,1.3,1.3,1.6,1.9,1.4,1.6,1.4,1.5,1.4,4.7,4.5,4.9,4,4.6,4.5,4.7,3.3,4.6,3.9,3.5,4.2,4,4.7,3.6,4.4,4.5,4.1,4.5,3.9,4.8,4,4.9,4.7,4.3,4.4,4.8,5,4.5,3.5,3.8,3.7,3.9,5.1,4.5,4.5,4.7,4.4,4.1,4,4.4,4.6,4,3.3,4.2,4.2,4.2,4.3,3,4.1,6,5.1,5.9,5.6,5.8,6.6,4.5,6.3,5.8,6.1,5.1,5.3,5.5,5,5.1,5.3,5.5,6.7,6.9,5,5.7,4.9,6.7,4.9,5.7,6,4.8,4.9,5.6,5.8,6.1,6.4,5.6,5.1,5.6,6.1,5.6,5.5,4.8,5.4,5.6,5.1,5.1,5.9,5.7,5.2,5,5.2,5.4,5.1],"PetalWidth":[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.2,0.4,0.4,0.3,0.3,0.3,0.2,0.4,0.2,0.5,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.4,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.1,0.2,0.2,0.3,0.3,0.2,0.6,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,1.4,1.5,1.5,1.3,1.5,1.3,1.6,1,1.3,1.4,1,1.5,1,1.4,1.3,1.4,1.5,1,1.5,1.1,1.8,1.3,1.5,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.4,1.7,1.5,1,1.1,1,1.2,1.6,1.5,1.6,1.5,1.3,1.3,1.3,1.2,1.4,1.2,1,1.3,1.2,1.3,1.3,1.1,1.3,2.5,1.9,2.1,1.8,2.2,2.1,1.7,1.8,1.8,2.5,2,1.9,2.1,2,2.4,2.3,1.8,2.2,2.3,1.5,2.3,2,2,1.8,2.1,1.8,1.8,1.8,2.1,1.6,1.9,2,2.2,1.5,1.4,2.3,2.4,1.8,1.8,2.1,2.4,2.3,1.9,2.3,2.5,2.3,1.9,2,2.3,1.8],"Species":["setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","setosa","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","versicolor","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica","virginica"]},"color":"Species","type":"point"}],"facet":{"type":"wrap","var":"Species"},"guides":[]}
